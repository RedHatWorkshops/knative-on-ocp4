# Blue Green Deployments with Knative serving
In this chapter we will learn traffic splitting with Knative Serving

## Prerequisites
* Application Image was built earlier
* `kn` CLI installed

## Deploy Knative Service

### Blue Revision
Let us deploy application version 1 using the container image we created earlier. Note the parameters 
* `revision-name` to name the revision as `blue` which will suffixed to the service name
* environment variable `format` configures this app to not change the messages
* environment variable `color` configures this app to print message in blue color
* environment variable `message` is the message that is output by default
  
```
kn service create msgtxr-sl \
--image=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/msgtxr \
--revision-name=blue \
-l app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus \
--env format=none \
--env color=blue \
--env message="Version 1 prints this message in BLUE"
```
Output
```
Creating service 'msgtxr-sl' in namespace 'kn-demo':

  0.340s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
  0.568s Configuration "msgtxr-sl" is waiting for a Revision to become ready.
  5.171s ...
  5.306s Ingress has not yet been reconciled.
  5.421s Ready to serve.

Service 'msgtxr-sl' created to latest revision 'msgtxr-sl-blue' is available at URL:
http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.YOURDOMAIN
```
Get revision list and notice the revision name and how `blue` is suffixed. 
```
% kn revision list
NAME             SERVICE     TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-sl-blue   msgtxr-sl   100%             1            45s   4 OK / 4     True 
```

Get URL for the application

```
export URL=$(kn route list  | awk  'NR>1 {print $2}')
```
Verify by calling this URL `curl -w "\n" $URL`

### Green Revision

Let us now update the service to create a new GREEN revision but not send any traffic to this new revision yet . Notice the parameters
* `revision-name` that will suffix `green`
* `traffic` that shows the split of traffic between revisions `v1` and `v2`

```
kn service update msgtxr-sl \
--revision-name=green \
--env format=none \
--env color=green \
--env message="Version 2 prints this message in GREEN" \
--traffic msgtxr-sl-blue=100
```

Output
```
Updating Service 'msgtxr-sl' in namespace 'kn-demo':

  0.456s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
  3.917s Ready to serve.

Service 'msgtxr-sl' updated to latest revision 'msgtxr-sl-green' is available at URL:
http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.YOURDOMAIN
```

Check revision list again. The output shows how traffic still goes to blue revision. 

```
% kn revision list

NAME              SERVICE     TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-sl-green   msgtxr-sl                    2            39s   4 OK / 4     True    
msgtxr-sl-blue    msgtxr-sl   100%             1            46m   3 OK / 4     True
```

You can verify running `curl -w"\n" $URL` that the traffic is still going to blue revision.

### Switch from Blue to Green

Let us update the knative service again to send all the traffic now to green revision.

`kn service update msgtxr-sl --traffic msgtxr-sl-green=100`

Verify the revision to see that the 100% of traffic should now be going to green revision.

```
 kn revision list
NAME              SERVICE     TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-sl-green   msgtxr-sl   100%             2            5m13s   3 OK / 4     True    
msgtxr-sl-blue    msgtxr-sl                    1            51m     3 OK / 4     True
```

and test again by running `curl -w "\n" $URL`  and the output should be
![topology image](./images/bluegreen2.png)

You can try switching between blue and green revisions by updating the traffic again.

### Conclusion

In this chapter we have learnt to do BlueGreen deployments with knative services.

### Cleanup

Delete the knative service by running

```
kn service delete msgtxr-sl
```
