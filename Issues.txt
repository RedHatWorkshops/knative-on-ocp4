Cloudevents Failing;
====================

Hi Ben for my demos today, I stood up a different cluster on AWS with only knative serving and knative eventing running on it. Nothing else was installed.

First time everything went fine when I tested.

Veer  18 hours ago
Then again when I was demoing I hit the issue  of posting to service

So this seems to have nothing to do with service mesh installation.

@Ben Browning I have the second cluster intact in case you want to see. The above issue is purely knative.. nothing to do with servicemesh.

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
@Veer sure - is the cloudevent not posting to your channel the only issue? serving works fine?

Veer  3 hours ago
yes serving works fine

Veer  3 hours ago
it is issue with cloudevents not posting both for channels and brokers

ok - I'll take a look :slightly_smiling_face:

yep - just logged in there to grab them  :slightly_smiling_face:

I see a ton of 2019/09/10 17:10:35 failed to send the request: Post http://zipkin.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:9411/api/v2/spans: dial tcp: lookup zipkin.istio-system.svc.cluster.local: no such host in your cronjob pod in the kn-demo namespace...

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
something is expecting zipkin to exist there?

Veer  3 hours ago
yeah.. that is harmless

Veer  3 hours ago
that dumpy app was written for zipkin, but it works without that

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
so how do I reproduce your issue posting events?

Veer  3 hours ago
it should be already there in the logs

Veer  3 hours ago
oh.. it seems to be working now somehow

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
yeah everything seems to be working

Veer  3 hours ago
yesterday it failed at the demo and it seems to have fixed itself later

Veer  3 hours ago
I think if I clean it up and create again, I will start hitting that issue again.

Veer  3 hours ago
at least for sometime.

Veer  3 hours ago
those cloudevent posting failures will exist for sometime and will look bad. Should I try to recreate the issue?

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
sure - if there's a bug here we need to track down what's up

Veer  3 hours ago
will do

Veer  3 hours ago
I will ping you back

Ben Browning  3 hours ago
thanks!

@Ben Browning The issue came back again. You can see it now on the same cluster

looking now

Ben Browning  1 hour ago
Something seems up with your install - I don't see any ClusterChannelProvisioners installed

Ben Browning  45 minutes ago
This is knative eventing 0.7.1? It seems like somehow eventing and the in-memory-channel are not installed right

Ben Browning  38 minutes ago
@lberk @matzew either if you may have more input here - something is up with this eventing install and it's not clear to me what it is

Ben Browning  37 minutes ago
@Veer this is a vanilla knative eventing install via our operator? nothing manually modified here?

Veer  37 minutes ago
yes

Veer  37 minutes ago
vanilla install. This is the exact same thing that was working before (edited)

https://github.com/openshift/knative-eventing/pull/271 related perhaps?

Veer  34 minutes ago
@Ben Browning The only thing running on the cluster is knative

Veer  34 minutes ago
and tekton of course

Veer  34 minutes ago
I created it for demo yesterday

Veer  32 minutes ago
One observation - First time it all works fine. Once you delete the app and try to do it again, the problem shows up. I had the same issue on my other cluster. But since we suspected servicemesh, I did set up this separate cluster.



Ben Browning  32 minutes ago
how are you deleting the app?

Veer  31 minutes ago
like here https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/6.AddingChannelsAndSubscriptions.md#cleanup

Veer  31 minutes ago
and then oc delete all --all -n kn-demo (edited)

Veer  31 minutes ago
and then oc delete project kn-demo

Veer  30 minutes ago
sometimes the project gets stuck in Terminating state for ever. If that happens, I remove the finalizer to clean it up

Ben Browning  22 minutes ago
that's your problem - oc delete all --all is deleting the clusterchannelprovision

Ben Browning  22 minutes ago
the change @lberk shared above removes clusterchannelprovisioner from the all category to fix this, but for now you can't do that :smile:

Ben Browning  21 minutes ago
that's why it works the 1st time and is broken the 2nd

Veer  15 minutes ago
ah.. so do you have any thoughts on how it fixed itself overnight?

Veer  14 minutes ago
But wait, I am deleting the project and creating again from scratch (everything)

Ben Browning  14 minutes ago
that provisioner is a cluster-scoped resource

Veer  13 minutes ago
oh.. so cluster-scoped resource is getting deleted with delete all  --all ? Then it makes sense on why it doesnt work

Veer  13 minutes ago
but I am not sure how it fixed itself though

Ben Browning  13 minutes ago
it fixed itself because the period global resync of the in-memory-channel-controller pod noticed at some point the provisioner was gone and recreated it

Ben Browning  12 minutes ago
or something did - at least that's my guess

Ben Browning  10 minutes ago
actually it looks like our eventing operator did that for you

Ben Browning  10 minutes ago
a bug in our eventing operator would be that it didn't notice immediately you deleted the provisioner - ideally it would notice immediately and recreate it for you :slightly_smiling_face:

Veer  9 minutes ago
yeah.. operator noticing and adding it back makes sense

Veer  8 minutes ago
I can confirm looking at the results of oc delete all --all that the clusterchannelprovisioner for in-memory channel was deleted.

Veer  7 minutes ago
I think if I scale the eventing operator to zero and start it again, it should add it back

Veer  5 minutes ago
Yep it worked. I had to scale in-memory-channel-controller to  0 and scale it back to 1

Ben Browning  5 minutes ago
cool

Veer  4 minutes ago
how did you find what the issue was?

Ben Browning  4 minutes ago
Well, I saw there was no ClusterChannelProvisioner in your cluster at all

Ben Browning  4 minutes ago
and there should be 1 for each type of channel you're using

Veer  4 minutes ago
ok

Ben Browning  3 minutes ago
so then it was just figuring out what caused it to go away

Veer  3 minutes ago
what should be there for broker?

Ben Browning  2 minutes ago
I'm not sure - @lberk do you know what specific broker artifacts to look for to ensure the broker is properly enabled for a namespace?
