# Add an Event Source to the App

**Event Sources** are the components that receive the external events and forward them onto **Sinks**.

**Note :** `kn` doesn't have Knative Eventing implemented yet. So we will be using yaml files for now.

Different types of event sources are possible that are [listed here](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/). In this example we will add an event source to test Direct delivery.

Direct delivery from a source to a single Service (an Addressable endpoint, including a Knative Service or a core Kubernetes Service). In this case, the Source is responsible for retrying or queueing events if the destination Service is not available.


## Prerequisites
* Knative Eventing is installed
* You have a Knative service deployed

## Add a Direct Event Source

Let us create an event source based on a `CronJobSource`. In this example,we will use our previously deployed application as the sink.

```
$ cat eventing/event-source.yaml 
apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CronJobSource 
metadata:
  name: event-dumpy-cronjob-source
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  sink:
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Service
    name: dumpy-serverless 

```

Before creating this event source, let us confirm that no pods are running by ensuring that the output of `$ oc get po -n kn-demo | grep Running` is empty.

Add the event source now.

```
$ oc create -f eventing/event-source.yaml 

cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-cronjob-source created
```

You can confirm the source is created by running

```
$ oc get sources
NAME                                                                    AGE
cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-cronjob-source   24m
```

Now, the `CronJobSource` starts sending events to the knative service and you will observing that the pod is up and running.

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
cronjob-event-dumpy-cronjob-source-srhpt-5f8dbff86c-2xmhq   1/1     Running     0          31s
```

You will notice two pods running now:
* CronJobEventSource will run as a pod
* Knative service for our application is a separate pod.


```
$ oc get po  | grep Running
cronjob-event-dumpy-cronjob-source-srhpt-5f8dbff86c-2xmhq   1/1     Running     0          19m
dumpy-serverless-7qr8q-deployment-7448977b64-wqbzk          2/2     Running     0          18m

```

Note the application's pod name. You can watch the logs for the application to verify that the app is being called continuously  by running 

```oc logs -f PODNAME -c user-container```

and you should see logs like below:

```

## Cleanup the Event Source

Get the event source name
```
$ oc get sources
NAME                                                                    AGE
cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-cronjob-source   24m
```

Delete the event source

```
$ oc delete cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-cronjob-source
cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev "event-dumpy-cronjob-source" deleted
```

The event source pod should have been deleted

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
dumpy-serverless-7qr8q-deployment-7448977b64-wqbzk   2/2     Running     0          26m
```

In a minute or so, the application pod should scale down to 0.

We saw a simple example of a direct event source in this lab.
