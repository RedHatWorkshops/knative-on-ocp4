# Add an Event Source to the App

**Event Sources** are the components that receive the external events and forward them onto **Sinks**.

**Note :** `kn` doesn't have Knative Eventing implemented yet. So we will be using yaml files for now.

Different types of event sources are possible that are [listed here](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/). In this example we will add an event source to test Direct delivery.

Direct delivery from a source to a single Service (an Addressable endpoint, including a Knative Service or a core Kubernetes Service). In this case, the Source is responsible for retrying or queueing events if the destination Service is not available.


## Prerequisites
* Knative Eventing is installed
* You have a Knative service deployed. Add a knative service running `kn service create msgtxr-sl --image=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/msgtxr -l app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus --env format=none`

## Add a Direct Event Source

Let us create an event source based on a `PingSource` that generates an event every `1 minute`. In this example,we will use our previously deployed application as the sink.

```
kn source ping create msgtxr-pingsource \
--schedule="* * * * *" \
--data="This message is from PingSource" \
--sink svc:msgtxr-sl

Ping source 'msgtxr-pingsource' created in namespace 'kn-demo'.
```

You can confirm the source is created by running

```
$ kn source ping list

NAME                SCHEDULE    SINK            AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-pingsource   * * * * *   svc:msgtxr-sl   4m30s   6 OK / 6     True
```

Now, the `PingSource` starts sending events to the knative service and you will observe that the pod is up and running.

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
pingsource-msgtxr-pingsour-48373f6a-da18-4484-b309-2b88c29bjcg6  1/1     Running     0          31s
```

In about a minute, you will notice two pods running :
* PingEventSource will run as a pod
* Knative service for our application is a separate pod.


```
% oc get po | grep Running
msgtxr-sl-fzpfp-1-deployment-d55996b47-r4n52                      2/2     Running     0          4m54s
pingsource-msgtxr-pingsour-48373f6a-da18-4484-b309-2b88c29bjcg6   1/1     Running     0          5m25s

```

Note the application's pod name. You can watch the logs for the application to verify that the app is being called continuously  by running 

```oc logs -f $(oc get po | grep msgtxr-sl | awk '{print $1}') -c user-container```

and you should see logs like below:

```
__  ____  __  _____   ___  __ ____  ______ 
 --/ __ \/ / / / _ | / _ \/ //_/ / / / __/ 
 -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ ,< / /_/ /\ \   
--\___\_\____/_/ |_/_/|_/_/|_|\____/___/

04:18:00.006 IN {"body":"This message is from PingSource"} OUT {"body":"This message is from PingSource"}
...
...
```

You will notice from the logs that the events coming in every 1 minute from the cron job.

## Cleanup the Event Source

Delete the event source

```
% kn source ping delete msgtxr-pingsource

Ping source 'msgtxr-pingsource' deleted in namespace 'kn-demo'.
```
This should remove the event source pod. In a minute or so, the application pod should scale down to 0.


## Conclusion
We saw a simple example of a direct event source in this lab.
