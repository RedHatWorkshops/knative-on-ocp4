# Deploy Serverless App using Knative Serving

## Prerequisites
* Application was built earlier
* `kn` CLI installed

## Install the Application

* Get the image repository name by running `oc get is`. This image was created using the openshift build in the last lab.

```
$ oc get is -n kn-demo
NAME    IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                 TAGS     UPDATED
dumpy   image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/msgtxr   latest   28 minutes ago

```
Copy the name of the `image repository` from above.


Create a knative service by running

```
kn service create msgtxr-sl --image=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/msgtxr -l app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus
```

This command runs synchronously. It takes a few seconds for the app to be deployed as a knative application.

```
Creating service 'msgtxr-sl' in namespace 'kn-demo':

  0.329s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
  0.466s Configuration "msgtxr-sl" is waiting for a Revision to become ready.
  4.334s ...
  4.457s Ingress has not yet been reconciled.
  4.926s Ready to serve.

Service 'msgtxr-sl' created to latest revision 'msgtxr-sl-bkfyg-1' is available at URL:
http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.YOURDOMAIN
```

Note that the output also displays the service URL.

Access the URL in the browser and watch the running application. This is the same application as in the last lab. But it now works with Knative Serving.

If you wait for a minute without using the application and you will observe that the application automagically scales down to 0.

Yeay!! We have now deployed and tested our application using Knative-serving.

But wait what does this `kn create service` create. Let us explore now.

## Explore the Knative Serving Objects

List all Knative services:

```
$ kn service list
NAME        URL                                                    LATEST              AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-sl   http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.apps.ocp4.home.ocpcloud.com   msgtxr-sl-bkfyg-1   4m45s   3 OK / 3     True   
```

List all Knative revisions:

```
$ kn revision list
NAME                SERVICE     TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE    CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-sl-bkfyg-1   msgtxr-sl   100%             1            5m8s   3 OK / 4     True
```

List all Knative routes:
```
NAME        URL                                                    READY
msgtxr-sl   http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.YOURDOMAIN   True
```

Describe a Knative service:

```
$ kn service describe msgtxr-sl
Name:       msgtxr-sl
Namespace:  kn-demo
Labels:     app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus
Age:        6m
URL:        http://msgtxr-sl-kn-demo.YOURDOMAIN

Revisions:  
  100%  @latest (msgtxr-sl-bkfyg-1) [1] (6m)
        Image:  image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/msgtxr (pinned to 476b55)

Conditions:  
  OK TYPE                   AGE REASON
  ++ Ready                   6m 
  ++ ConfigurationsReady     6m 
  ++ RoutesReady             6m 
```

### Cleaning up:

Run the following command when you want to remove the knative service. If you are doing next chapter, we will be using it again, so don't remove this service yet. 

```
$ kn service delete msgtxr-sl
Service 'msgtxr-sl' successfully deleted in namespace 'kn-demo'.
```
