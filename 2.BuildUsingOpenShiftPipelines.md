# Build using OpenShift Pipeline


## Pre-requisites
* OCP4 cluster with Knative-serving, Tekton installed
* You need to be logged in as admin credentials
* `git clone` this repository. We have some samples here.

## Steps

* Login as an `admin` user to your cluster

* Create a new project for your application `oc new-project kn-demo`

* Create a service account for your pipeline

```
oc create serviceaccount pipeline
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z pipeline
```

We will use Openshift S2I to run the build.

Let us install tekton tasks for `s2i-go` and  `openshift-client`.

* `s2i-go` task is used to build an application written in golang
* `openshift-client` allows us to run `oc` commands as part of the pipeline

**Note:** List of S2I build tasks available for different languages can be found here:
[https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog)

```
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog/master/s2i-go/s2i-go-task.yaml

oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/openshift-client/openshift-client-task.yaml

```


Now we will create the application objects `imagestream`, `deploymentconfig`, `service` and `route`. These objects are made available the pipeline folder.

```
$ oc create -f pipeline/openshift-objects.yaml 
imagestream.image.openshift.io/dumpy created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/dumpy created
service/dumpy created
route.route.openshift.io/dumpy created
```


Let us look at the pipeline that shows the list of tasks within the pipeline to create the application image using `s2i-go` task and deploy it using `openshift-client` task. Note that this pipeline depends on source code coming from `app-git` and pushes image to `app-image` resource.

```
$ cat pipeline/pipeline.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  - name: app-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: s2i-go
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        value: "false"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: app-image
  - name: deploy
    taskRef:
      name: openshift-client
    runAfter:
      - build
    params:
    - name: ARGS
      value: "rollout latest dumpy"
```

Let us create the pipeline by running

```
$ oc create -f pipeline/pipeline.yaml 

pipeline.tekton.dev/deploy-pipeline created
```


The resources used by this pipeline are defined in the `pipeline-resources` file as shown below:

```
$ cat pipeline/pipeline-resources.yaml 
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: application-image
spec:
  type: image
  params:
  - name: url
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/dumpy
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: sourcecode-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
  - name: url
    value: https://github.com/redhatworkshops/openshift-knative-application

```

Now let us add these pipeline-resources running:

```
$ oc create -f pipeline/pipeline-resources.yaml 

pipelineresource.tekton.dev/application-image created
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/sourcecode-git created
```

Let us use `tkn` to verify all the objects we just created as shown below:

```
$ tkn tasks list
NAME               AGE
openshift-client   11 seconds ago
s2i-go             3 hours ago

$ tkn pipeline list
NAME              AGE           LAST RUN   STARTED   DURATION   STATUS
deploy-pipeline   2 hours ago   ---        ---       ---        ---

$ tkn resource list
NAME                TYPE    DETAILS
application-image   image   url: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kn-demo/dumpy
sourcecode-git      git     url: https://github.com/redhatworkshops/openshift-knative-application

```

Now let us run the pipeline using `tkn`. In the future you will also be able to start pipeline from devconsole. 
* `-s` option is to pass the Service Account used to run this pipeline.
* `-r` option is used to pass the values for resources. Our pipeline above uses 2 resources and their values are already defined in the pipeline resources. So we are just passing those pipeline resources inputs while running the pipeline

`tkn pipeline start` will create a new `pipelinerun` object to start the pipeline.

```
$ tkn pipeline start deploy-pipeline -s pipeline -r app-git=sourcecode-git -r app-image=application-image

Pipelinerun started: deploy-pipeline-run-zlzqc
```
Note the name of the `pipelinerun` created above. We will use this to track the pipeline logs next. Run the following command to watch the logs.

```
$ tkn pipelinerun logs -f deploy-pipeline-run-zlzqc
```

This will output the logs as below:

```
[build : build-step-git-source-sourcecode-git-7bz5r] {"level":"warn","ts":1564597690.2913275,"logger":"fallback-logger","caller":"logging/config.go:65","msg":"Fetch GitHub commit ID from kodata failed: \"KO_DATA_PATH\" does not exist or is empty"}

```

You can also observe the running pipeline on devconsole. Navigate to your project `kn-demo` -> `Pipelines` from menu ->  select the pipelinerun that is currently in progress

You will see a screen like this:
