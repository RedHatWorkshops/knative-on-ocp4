# Install  Knative, OpenShift Pipelines and  Client Tools

## Install Knative Serving, Knative Eventing and OpenShift Pipelines

This tutorial has been tested with the following version.
```
OCP 4.2.4
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 1.0.2
OpenShift Serverless Operator 1.1.0 (Tech Preview)
Knative Eventing v 0.9.0
OpenShift Pipelines Operator  0.7.0
kn client v20191011-a2d1ef7
```
**Note:** OpenShift Pipelines and Serverless Operator is still in dev and tech preview. Knative Eventing Operator is community and hence not supported by Red Hat yet.

### Installing Service Mesh

* Go to Operator hub and install OpenShift Service Mesh. The documentation is provided here (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html#installing-service-mesh_installing-openshift-serverless)[https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html#installing-service-mesh_installing-openshift-serverless]. 
**Note** The knative-serving's requirements from service mesh are different from a (complete Istio Install for other purposes)[https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/installing-ossm.html]. 

For OpenShift Service Mesh , you should see the following pods running in the `istio-system` project.

```
$ oc get po -n istio-system
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cluster-local-gateway-c5599767c-8zfmd   1/1     Running   1          3d23h
istio-citadel-76665b9988-b29l4          1/1     Running   3          3d23h
istio-galley-669b949cff-4nq2p           1/1     Running   1          3d23h
istio-ingressgateway-5d477cfc7c-4c8pk   1/1     Running   1          3d23h
istio-pilot-649fc9878c-j7kwj            1/1     Running   1          3d23h
```
### Setting up ServiceMeshMemberRoll
Once ServiceMesh is installed, add the following projects to ServiceMeshMemberRoll (SMMR) as explained here https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/installing-ossm.html#ossm-member-roll-create-console_installing-ossm. 

Projects to be added to SMMR: `knative-serving`, `knative-eventing`, and `kn-demo`. 
* Project with name `knative-serving` is where Knative Serving will be installed
* Project with name `knative-eventing` is where Knative eventing will be installed
* Project with name `kn-demo` is where we are going to deploy our application and test

### Installing rest of the Operators
* Go to Operator hub and install Knative serving using OpenShift Serverless Operator (provided by Red Hat) as explained here (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html)[https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html]
* Go to Operator hub and install  Knative Eventing using Operator  (Community version). Note Red Hat operator is not released yet.
* Go to Operator hub and install OpenShift Pipelines using Operator (provided by Red Hat)

Once operator starts running, click on `1 Installed`, to create CR.


You will see the following operators in the `openshift-operators` project once the operators are installed.

```
