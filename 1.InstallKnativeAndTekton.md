## Install Knative Serving, Knative Eventing and OpenShift Pipelines

This tutorial has been tested with the following version. 
```
OCP 4.1.7
Knative Serving 0.71
Knative Eventing v 0.71
OpenShift Pipelines Operator  0.5.0
kn client 0.2.0
```
**Note:** The operators are all Community versions and not supported by Red Hat yet.

**Note:** We are not installing Istio and letting Knative choose the components needed for 
* Go to Operator hub and install Knative Serving using Operator (Community version)
* Go to Operator hub and install  Knative Eventing using Operator  (Community version)
* Go to Operator hub and install OpenShift Pipelines using Operator (Community version)

Once operator starts running, click on `1 Installed`, to create CR. 


You will see the following operators in the `openshift-operators` project once the operators are installed.

```
$ oc get po -n openshift-operators
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

knative-serving-operator-f4946fb7d-mf4jk        1/1     Running   0          7d12h
openshift-pipelines-operator-69cd5bc894-hmr7b   1/1     Running   0          76s
```


For Knative-Serving you should see the following pods running in the `knative-serving` project

```
$ oc get po -n knative-serving
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

Knative-serving also installs minimal istio that it needs. So you should find the following pods in the `istio-system` project

```
$ oc get po -n istio-system
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cluster-local-gateway-7447859495-7tcnh   1/1     Running   0          7d12h
istio-ingressgateway-75bffcfb5-7t5rs     1/1     Running   0          7d12h
istio-pilot-77d5cd65b4-22v72             1/1     Running   0          7d12h
```

For Knative-eventing, you will see the following pods in the `knative-eventing` project

```
$ oc get po -n knative-eventing
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

For OpenShift Pipelines, you will see the following pods in the `openshift-pipelines` project.

```
$ oc get po -n openshift-pipelines
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

tekton-pipelines-webhook-5565868b59-zwrpf      1/1     Running   0          2m24s
