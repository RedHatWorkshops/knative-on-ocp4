# Install  Knative, OpenShift Pipelines and  Client Tools

## Install Knative Serving, Knative Eventing and OpenShift Pipelines

This tutorial has been tested with the following version.
```
OCP 4.1.14
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 1.0.0
Serverless Operator 1.0.0
Knative Eventing v 0.71
OpenShift Pipelines Operator  0.5.2
kn client v20190903-6790961
```
**Note:** OpenShift Pipelines and Serverless Operator is still in dev and tech preview. Knative Eventing Operator is community and hence not supported by Red Hat yet.

### Installing Service Mesh

* Go to Operator hub and install OpenShift Service Mesh (if it is not already available on your cluster). The documentation is provided here https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/installing-ossm.html  This installation involves multiple components viz., kiali, jaeger, elasticsearch and then service mesh. 

For OpenShift Service Mesh , you should see the following pods running in the `istio-system` project.

```
$ oc get po -n istio-system
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```
### Setting up ServiceMeshMemberRoll
Once ServiceMesh is installed, add the following projects to ServiceMeshMemberRoll (SMMR) as explained here https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/installing-ossm.html#ossm-member-roll_installing-ossm. 

Projects to be added to SMMR: `knative-serving`, `knative-eventing`, and `kn-demo`. 
* Project with name `knative-serving` is where Knative Serving will be installed
* Project with name `knative-eventing` is where Knative eventing will be installed
* Project with name `kn-demo` is where we are going to deploy our application and test

### Installing rest of the Operators
* Go to Operator hub and install Knative serving using Serverless Operator  (provided by Red Hat)
* Go to Operator hub and install  Knative Eventing using Operator  (Community version). Note Red Hat operator is not released yet.
* Go to Operator hub and install OpenShift Pipelines using Operator (provided by Red Hat)

Once operator starts running, click on `1 Installed`, to create CR.


You will see the following operators in the `openshift-operators` project once the operators are installed.

### Temporary fix for Knative-eventing

ServiceMesh sets up Network Policies that prevent connections between your application and pods running in `knative-serving`. In order to enable those communications, we will add some network policies that allow those.

Run the following command

```
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/master/network-policies/knative-eventing-network-policies.yaml
```

Eventually Knative Eventing Operator would apply this fix to allow communications.
