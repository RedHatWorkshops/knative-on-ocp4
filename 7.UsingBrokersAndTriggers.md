# Using Brokers and Triggers

Event Sources are the components that receive the external events and forward them onto Sinks which can be mediated by a Trigger. Triggers offer an opportunity to filter out events by attributes. Triggers are used to connect Knative Serving application to a Broker so that it can respond to the events that the Broker emits.


## Create an Event Source

This time we will create a ContainerSource that uses a heartbeat container. This is a heartbeat which generates events at a configurable rate, to be forwarded to the given sink. That sink is a broker that will be created shortly. 

```
apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerSource
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-event-source
spec:
  image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-heartbeats:v0.13.2
  args:
   - '--label="from heartbeat source"'
   - '--period=20'
  env:
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name
    - name: POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  sink:
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Broker
    name: default
```

* The above source will generate an event once every 20s.

Let us create the event source

```
$ oc create -f eventing/event-source-heartbeat.yaml
containersource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/heartbeat-event-source created
```

Verify

```
$ oc get containersources
NAME                     AGE
heartbeat-event-source   49s
```

## Add a Broker 

In order to create broker, we will have to label the namespace for `knative-eventing-injection=enabled` and it will automatically add broker with the name `default`.

```
$ oc label namespace kn-demo knative-eventing-injection=enabled
namespace/kn-demo labeled
```

```
$ oc get po -w
NAME                                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
default-broker-filter-59b5bc56-fjq75                1/1     Running             0          4m5s
default-broker-ingress-74759d5995-76lj5             1/1     Running             0          4m5s
```


## Create a Trigger and Broker

Let us create a trigger that connects the source to our Knative service. With `kn` this command can also add a broker at the same time.

```
kn trigger create msgtxr-trigger \
--inject-broker --broker default \
--filter type=dev.knative.eventing.samples.heartbeat \
--sink svc:msgtxr-sl
```


* The event type `dev.knative.eventing.samples.heartbeat` is the one used by the ContainerSource image we deployed earlier.
* Subscriber is our knative service
* `--inject-broker` will inject the broker into namespace. Alternately we could have requested system administrator to add this broker to the namespace by running `
oc label namespace kn-demo knative-eventing-injection=enabled`
since labeling a namespace requires privileged user. But luckily we have `kn` handling this for us.

Verify

```
$ kn trigger list

NAME             BROKER    SINK            AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
msgtxr-trigger   default   svc:msgtxr-sl   24m   5 OK / 5     True  
```

## Observe the Events in Action

List the pods running now. You'll see an heartbeat event source pod that starts generating events and your Knative service acting as the destination via the broker.

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
containersource-heartbeat--282bc5ef-c409-4319-9c98-177988558vg7   1/1     Running     0          21m
default-broker-filter-7d89b8d949-kw5z2                            1/1     Running     0          25m
default-broker-ingress-6b5d8cf558-2f87x                           1/1     Running     0          25m
msgtxr-sl-fzpfp-1-deployment-d55996b47-r9c4k                      2/2     Running     0          20m
```


Look at your Knative service logs, and you will see the heartbeats received from the heartbeat event source once in `20s`.

```
$ oc logs -f $(oc get po | grep msgtxr-sl | awk '{print $1}') -c user-container

```

Let us edit the event source to increase the time to 180s.

```
$ cat eventing/event-source-heartbeat-180s.yaml 
apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerSource
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-event-source
spec:
  image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-heartbeats:v0.7.1 
  args:
   - '--label="from heartbeat source"'
   - '--period=180'
  env:
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name
    - name: POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  sink:
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Broker
    name: default
```

Let us apply this change

```
$ oc replace -f eventing/event-source-heartbeat-180s.yaml 
containersource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/heartbeat-event-source replaced
```

Now observe your Knative destination service by running `watch oc get po ` or in the developer console.

You will notice that the the Knative application scales to zero after a minute and a new pod comes up every 120s due to heartbeat.

## Conclusion

In this lab we have learnt to configure a container based event source, a broker and a trigger that subscribes the event source to a destination.

## Cleanup

Delete Eventsource

```
$ oc delete -f eventing/event-source-heartbeat.yaml
containersource.sources.eventing.knative.dev "heartbeat-event-source" deleted
```

Delete  Trigger

```
$ kn trigger delete msgtxr-trigger 

Trigger 'msgtxr-trigger' deleted in namespace 'kn-demo'.
```

Remove Broker

Currently you will have to approach your cluster admin to label your namespace this way
```
$ oc label namespace kn-demo knative-eventing-injection=disabled --overwrite=true

namespace/kn-demo labeled
```

and you can remove the broker pods in your namespace this way
```
$ oc delete brokers.eventing.knative.dev --all

broker.eventing.knative.dev "default" deleted

```

Now there should be no running pods

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
```
