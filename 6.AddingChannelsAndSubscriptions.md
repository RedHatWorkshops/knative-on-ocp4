# Adding Channels and Subscriptions

We can fan-out delivery from an Event source to multiple endpoints using Channels and Subscriptions. In this case, the Channel implementation ensures that messages are delivered to the requested destinations and should buffer the events if the destination Service is unavailable.

## Create a Channel

Different types of [channels](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/channels/) are possible such as Apache Kafka, GCPPubSub, InMemoryChannel etc. In this example we will create an InMemoryChannel with the following yaml. This is a best effort channel for development usage.

```
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: ch-event-dumpy
spec:
  provisioner: 
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterChannelProvisioner
    name: in-memory-channel
```

Let us create the channel.

```
$ oc create -f eventing/in-memory-channel.yaml 

channel.eventing.knative.dev/ch-event-dumpy created
```

Verify

```
$ oc get channels
NAME             READY   REASON   AGE
ch-event-dumpy   True             48s
```

## Add an Event Source with Channel as the Sink

This time we will again add an event source. But unlike last direct delivery example, the event source in this case will use the above channel as the sink.

```
apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CronJobSource
metadata:
  name: event-dumpy-cronjob-source
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  sink:
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Channel
    name: ch-event-dumpy
```
* We are using CronJobSource as the event source in this example as well
* **Note** the  `sink` here points to the channel we created above.

Let us create this channel

```
$ oc create -f eventing/event-source-to-channel.yaml 

cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-cronjob-source created
```

Verify

```
$ oc get cronjobsource
NAME                         AGE
event-dumpy-cronjob-source   13s

```

At this point the  events are being generated but no data should be flowing into the application yet. Run 

```
$ oc get po  | grep Running
cronjob-event-dumpy-cronjob-source-dzccx-76c95574c9-q6m2f   1/1     Running     0          41s
```

You should see the event source pod running. It is pushing workloads to a  sink which is the InMemory channel. But, since the channel is not subscribed by anyone the events are not getting anywhere.

## Add an Event Subscriber

Event subscription allows an event destination to subscribe to a channel. In our case we will configure our service as the destination.


```
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: event-dumpy-subscriber
spec:
  channel:
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Channel
    name: ch-event-dumpy
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: Service
      name: dumpy-serverless
```

Let us create the subscription

```
$ oc create -f eventing/event-subscription.yaml 

subscription.eventing.knative.dev/event-dumpy-subscriber created
```

Verify

```
$ oc get subscription.eventing.knative.dev
NAME                     READY   REASON   AGE
event-dumpy-subscriber   True             52s
```

Wait a min or so and you should see the serverless pod coming up

```
$ oc get po | grep Running
cronjob-event-dumpy-cronjob-source-dzccx-76c95574c9-q6m2f   1/1     Running     0          8m54s
dumpy-serverless-956fn-deployment-65cb7f5d97-z6ffq          2/2     Running     0          60s
```

## Summary

In this lab, we have learn to add a Channel that listens to an Event Source and then we added our Knative service as the destination that subscribes to the Channel

## Cleanup

Let us delete the event source.

```
$ oc delete -f eventing/event-source-to-channel.yaml 
cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev "event-dumpy-cronjob-source" deleted
```

You should the event source pod go away immediately. If you wait a minute,our serverless service also scales down to zero.

Delete the channel

```
$ oc delete -f eventing/in-memory-channel.yaml 
channel.eventing.knative.dev "ch-event-dumpy" deleted

```
